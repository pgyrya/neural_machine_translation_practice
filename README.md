# Practice Project - Neural Machine Translation
Acknowledgements
I have leveraged established Python libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow to implement neural translation algorithm discussed in this report. For neural network architecture, I have leveraged code base shared on the following GitHub repositories of [seq2seq](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/seq2seq) and [recurrentshop](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/recurrentshop) shared as open source by Fariz Rahman. 

After leveraging this library, I have also discovered another interesting and illustrative implementation of similar approach at GitHub location of [keras-attention](https://github.com/datalogue/keras-attention) shared by Datalogue.
